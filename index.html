        <h2 class="heading">contact</h2>
        <p class="text">Explain why someone should contact your business. Describe how your business can help solve the visitors' problems. Include an email and phone number so visitors can get in touch with you on their first attempt. Include a short form using fields that'll help your business understand who's contacting them.</p>

    <div id="about">
        <h2 class="heading">about</h2>
        <p class="text">In contrast to a landing page, your About Us page is the ideal place to accommodate a number of objectives: Communicate the story of your business and why you started it. Describe the customers or the cause that your business serves. Explain your business model or how your products are made.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="help">
        <h2 class="heading">help</h2>
        <p class="text">Relate your restaurant's story to its core values. Tell them what struggles you had to overcome, what you learned from it, and how it impacted your values. In telling your story, show the reader what makes your restaurant unique without explicitly listing out its best features. A little bit of mystique goes a long way.</p>
